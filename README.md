# Scrabble-Blitz

Scrabble-Blitz is a fast-paced, engaging, and educational word game inspired by Scrabble. It challenges players to create words under a time limit using a set of randomly assigned tiles.


## Gameplay

The game is simple:

1. When the game starts, a single word is loaded onto the game board, and the player receives a tray of letter tiles.
2. The player attempts to make words on the game board using the tiles in their tray.
3. Points are awarded based on the length of the word and the value of the tiles used.
4. A timer counts down, and the game ends when time runs out.
5. The goal is to get as many points as possible before the timer runs out.


### Special Features

* `Shuffle`: If you're stuck and need new inspiration, you can shuffle the tiles in your tray to get a fresh perspective.
* `High Scores`: Keep track of your best games and challenge yourself to beat your highest score!


## Development

Scrabble-Blitz is being developed using Python (Flask), JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
