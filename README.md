## Description:
Scrabble-Blitz is a web-based board game inspired by Scrabble. It challenges players to create words under a time limit using a set of randomly assigned tiles.

## Gameplay

1. When the game starts, a single word is loaded onto the game board, and the player receives a tray of letter tiles.
2. The player attempts to make words on the game board using the tiles in their tray.
3. Points are awarded based on the value of the tiles used and the use of bonus squares. The value of the points also gets added to the timer in seconds. So if a word is worth 10 points you get 10 seconds added to the clock.
4. A timer counts down, and the game ends when time runs out.
5. The goal is to get as many points as possible before the timer runs out.


### Special Features

* `Shuffle`: If you're stuck and need new inspiration, you can shuffle the tiles in your tray to get a fresh perspective.

* `Discard`: If you're feeling stuck and want to change the tiles in your hand, you can choose to exchange them with new ones from the tile pool. This allows you to refresh your options and potentially find better combinations. Use this strategic move wisely to improve your chances of scoring big! Keep in mind you can only exchange tiles twice in a single game, so use your exchanges wisely.

* `High Scores`: Keep track of your best game and challenge yourself to beat your highest score!
