Extra credit
    As the rounds pass, I want an animation to bring in letters

Example 1       Example 2       Example 3
 _C_             _C_            _C_
 _AT             _AS            _A_
 _TO             _TT            _S_
                 __A            _E_ Case is initially loaded
                 __Y            _T_ When T is added, case not counted. 
                                    Set is counted

Solutions
Example 1: Prohibit letters A and T to be analyzed vertically
Example 2: Add potential word, 'stay' but if any of its letters 
           is part of an invalid word, then it gets removed

           What if a player adds two valid words that have an
           invalid letter?
                Don't count either of the two words. Capture
                invalid word into variable in order to communicate to player
           
           Should I make player add one word at a time?
                No, too restrictive. Give the player the freedom to make multiple 
                words      

Example 3: If word is invalid, do not check any of its letters
           in any direction

run_loop = True
while run_loop
    Loop through grid until a letter is reached

    'C' is a potential word
    check right and check under
    if letter
        add to potential word
    else
        stop checking
        break
    if a valid word
        - capture orientation, start and end coordinates
        - coordinates from start + 1 to end can only be examined 
        in the opposite orientation of the word its part of
            - In Example 1, 'A' and 'T' from CAT can only be examined
            in the horizontal direction. If not then AT would be valid word
            TODO: RESOLVES ISSUE WHERE WORD WITHIN WORD GETS COUNTED
        - run_loop = False
    else
        remove letter from board 
        if letter next to it, remove until blank or wall is reached
        run_loop = True
