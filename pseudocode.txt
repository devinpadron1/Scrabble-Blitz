while run_loop
    Loop through grid until a letter is reached

    'C' is a potential word
    check right and check under
    if letter
        add to potential word
    else
        stop checking
    if a valid word
        - capture orientation, start and end coordinates
        - coordinates from start + 1 to end can only be examined 
        in the opposite orientation of the word its part of
            - In Example 1, 'A' and 'T' from CAT can only be examined
            in the horizontal direction. If not then AT would be valid word
        - run_loop = False
    else
        remove letter from board 
        if letter next to it, remove until blank or wall is reached
